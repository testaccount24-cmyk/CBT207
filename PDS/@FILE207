//***file 207 is a Full Screen Editor from Citibank of New York,    *   FILE 207
//*           New York.  This data set contains the source modules  *   FILE 207
//*           and documentation for their 3270 Full Screen Editor,  *   FILE 207
//*           which is also an incore editor.  This is a TSO        *   FILE 207
//*           Full Screen Editor to be used solely for remote       *   FILE 207
//*           and local 3270 units.  It allows the simultaneous     *   FILE 207
//*           update and browse of up to 21 lines of a data set,    *   FILE 207
//*           and the execution of an FSE/TSO command at the same   *   FILE 207
//*           time.                                                 *   FILE 207

//*       This file was updated by Ed Liss and Rob Prins to work    *   FILE 207
//*       on 3270 mod 2, mod 3, and mod 4 terminals, where it       *   FILE 207
//*       exploits the extra row size.  However, if you use this    *   FILE 207
//*       version of FSE on other-sized terminals, it reverts to    *   FILE 207
//*       24x80.                                                    *   FILE 207
